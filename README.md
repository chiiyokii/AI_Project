**Here is a quick glance about what we plan to do :**


&emsp; Brittany is one of the best region of France, with it's cows crÃªpes and kouign amann, there is all you can want to spend so good time during vacations. But with the raising popularity of this destination among french people,the housing market skyrocketed. Indeed, everyday about a hundred of apartments and houses are sold. Today there is 13% more buyers than sellers so the prices are going up. But, as a buyer you should be careful that the lovely house you want to buy is priced fairly. That is why we wanted to create this AI model that can predict the selling price of a houses based on several criteria such as location, surface, floor ...

Dataset from kaggle we will use : [DatasetOfHousingPrice](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction)

This dataset is only composed of numbers. We have numerical features : square meters, number of rooms, floors, city code, city part range(0 cheapest 10 most expensive), the year it was built, the number of previous owners and also boolean features such as if there is a pool or a yard.  

After quickly reviewing the content of the dataset, we noticed that some of the features contain absurd values. We have to determine wether to keep those or adapt the values. For example, we could manage big values by dividing and rounding to approximately reach a normal scale of value.

Our first step is to understand our dataset with statistic analysis. Especially to look for null and unique values.
We plan to use more than two methods/libraries to build our ML AI model.
