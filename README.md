    We like art. Especially pictures and paintings. That is why our project is about an AI with the ability to distinguish between a painting and a photo. 
We plan to use a dataset containing real photos and paintings. The main goal would be to use a binary notation to differentiate the real photos and the paintings (example: ‘1’ for a real picture and ‘0’ for a painting). Then mix the dataset and train the AI.
